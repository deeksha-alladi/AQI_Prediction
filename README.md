## Air_Quality_Prediction

# 📌 Project Overview
The Air Quality Prediction Project focuses on forecasting air pollution levels to enhance environmental management and public health safety. This system leverages machine learning and real-time data analysis to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) and identify pollution trends.


### Key Features:
✅ **Real-time Data Processing** – Collects air quality data from various sources  
✅ **Pollutant Level Prediction** – Forecasts levels of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, etc.  
✅ **Machine Learning Models** – Uses Regression, Random Forest, or Deep Learning  
✅ **Visualization Dashboards** – Displays air quality trends in interactive charts  
✅ **Alerts & Notifications** – Sends alerts when pollution levels exceed safe limits
